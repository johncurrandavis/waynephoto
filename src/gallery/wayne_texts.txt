I don't usually do black and white, but sometimes scenes just lend themselves to it. We visited Yosemite a couple of years ago right after some of the biggest rains California had ever had, so the waterfalls were in full flow. Unfortunately we chose to go on Memorial weekend, so that and the falls meant the place was rammed around the main falls. The first one below, Lower Yosemite falls, was crowded so I had to clamber over a few rocks to get close enough to take one without people in it. The spray also meant I was wet through in less than a minute and had to constantly clear the lens to get a shot. I think I'll stick to dry land in future 🙂. The mill was on an island between Athens and Crete from an island hopping holiday last year.
